## Description
Epicodus JavaScript Week 2 Individual Project.

### Specifications
#### User Stories:
* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
  (is there a calorie counter API I could use to get this info?)
* I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
  (pipe, also wonder about displaying nutrition graphs/pie char?)
* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
(Further Exploration)
* Custom SASS styling with corresponding Gulp tasks to compile.
* Display of the total number of calories consumed in a day, and/or the average number of calories consumed in a day.
* Add a property that records when each food was eaten. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp.
* Expand the application to display multiple days of food logs. Group the food entries by day. Then include a component to display the total calories for whichever day the user selects.
* Add a new master component to average the total calories consumed per day so that the user can figure out how much exercise they should be getting on a regular basis.
